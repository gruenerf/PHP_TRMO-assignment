Class entries
Class topics

Frontend:
main page
    list of topics (chronological order or popularity (topics with highest number of entries in the last week) )-> save in cookie
    latest entries for randomly selected topic
    boolean search against topics/entries
    login/register

Register page
    Admin/writer

    User:
        create new topics
        create new entries related to topic (1000characters)
        delete entries and topics created by him,
        update his registration data (including the password)

    Admin:
        delete user
        add/delete categories,
        and delete any topic or entry,
        and see a summary (i.e., a list presenting the number of topics under each category).


Cookie:
    sorting of topic list


3 NOTES
• You should add indexes to your tables as necessary.
• It is sufficient to combine search keywords only with the ‘AND’ operator.
• You should use cookies to keep track of users’ preferences for topic ordering.
• You should use hashing to protect passwords.
• You should sanitise the user input and make a simple check against empty fields.
• Provide a ‘setup.php’ file to create the database.
• Create a sensible folder structure.
• Provide a ‘readme.txt’ file explaining how to get started.
• Your code should be well indented and commented.
• Your code should use proper variable names for readability.
• Look and feel of the pages is under your discretion.
• Your source code folder should be named ‘name-surname-assignement2’.
• Zip all your code into a single zip file named ‘name-surname-assignement2.zip’.
• This assignment has to be done individually!

4 HINTS
• You should consider coding a single page for common tasks and enable specific functionalities
depending on the user role. For instance in the main page for viewing entries
and topics, you could have a delete entry link next to an entry if the user is admin or
entry owner; or an add entry text box could be provided under the list of entries if the
user is logged in.
Good luck!
